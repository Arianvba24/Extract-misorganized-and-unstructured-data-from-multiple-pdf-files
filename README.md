# Extract-misorganized-and-unstructured-data-from-multiple-pdf-files
In this project we have in the ipynb file two scripts. One extract the data from 1 file and the other extract the data from multiple pdf files and uses the library regex to apply algorithms to extract the names and organize them in a list.

Feel free to check the file to see the finals results :)
